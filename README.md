## ✨ Key Features   

🖋️ Custom Font
The Avenir Next font was converted to .woff format and linked via:

This ensures a unique and consistent visual style, as defined in the original design. 

🎯 Flexbox  
Used for building flexible, responsive layouts — including navigation, sections, and button blocks.

🧱 CSS Grid  
Card section layout is built using CSS Grid, providing a clean, scalable structure.

📱 Responsive Design  
Fully responsive across devices — mobile, tablet, and desktop.
